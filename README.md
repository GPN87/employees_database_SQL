# Data modelling and analysis using PostgreSQL in PgAdmin
##Overview
This project takes a hypothetical database of employees made up of six .csv files, and:
- creates a schema to model the relationship between the tables using an entity relationship diagram (ERD);
- performs CRUD operations on the database once loaded into PostgreSQL.

Is a completed module assignment for data analyics and visualisation bootcamp I am doing.

##Queries
The > queries subdirectory contains this screenshot of the database schema:
![ERD screenshot](queries/ERD_employees.png)



Repository contains a .gitignore file that ignores .csv files contained in data
